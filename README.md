# Cognify

**Cognify** is a cutting-edge project designed to analyze and synthesize Indian Classical Music using AI, symbolic processing, and neural audio models. It is developed by **Team Fight Club 01**, led by **Musab Wasiuddin**, as part of a challenge focused on AI-driven musical analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **Music Analysis**: Extract musical features such as Raaga, Taal, pitch, and tempo.
- **Music Synthesis**: Generate Indian classical music using AI models.
- **Multi-Input Support**: Accepts audio recordings, Sargam notation, rhythm tapping, and humming.
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes advanced AI models like MusicBERT, RagaBERT, and Hidden Markov Models.
- **Frontend & Backend**: Flask/Django backend for processing and a React-based frontend for interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask/Django
- **AI & ML**: Librosa, Essentia, SpeechBrain, MusicBERT, RagaBERT, Hidden Markov Models
- **Music Synthesis**: WaveGAN, MelGAN

## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to set up **Cognify** on your local system:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Chiranjeevisai18/Cognify.git
   cd Cognify
   ```
